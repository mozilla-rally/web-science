/**
 * # Overview
 * This module addresses several challenges for studying user engagement with web content.
 *   * __Syncing Measurements and Interventions.__ A study that uses `WebScience` will
 *     often involve multiple measurements or interventions on a webpage. The
 *     `pageManager` module enables studies to sync these measurements and interventions
 *     by assigning a random unique identifier to each webpage.
 *   * __Generating Page Lifecycle Events.__ Measurements and interventions are often
 *     linked to specific events in the webpage lifecyle. The `pageManager` module
 *     standardizes a set of webpage lifecycle events.
 *   * __Tracking User Attention.__ Measurements and interventions often depend on user
 *     attention to web content. The `pageManager` module provides a standardized
 *     attention model that incorporates tab switching, window switching, application
 *     switching, locked screens, and user mouse and keyboard input.
 *   * __Generating Audio Events.__ This module provides events for webpage audio,
 *     enabling measurements and interventions based on media playback.
 *   * __Bridging the Background and Content Script Environments.__ WebExtensions
 *     includes two distinct execution environments: background scripts and content
 *     scripts. These execution environments are, unfortunately, only loosely bound
 *     together by tab IDs. As a result, there can be race conditions---the background
 *     and content environments can have mismatched states, such that messages arrive
 *     at the wrong webpage or are attributed to the wrong webpage. This module
 *     provides provides page lifecycle, user attention, and audio events that are
 *     bound to specific webpages.
 *
 * # Pages
 * This module creates an abstraction over webpages as perceived by users (i.e., when
 * content loads with a new HTTP(S) URL in the browser bar or the page visibly reloads).
 * Note that the History API enables web content to modify the URL without loading a new
 * HTML document via HTTP(S) or creating a new Document object. This module treats
 * a URL change via the History API as equivalent to traditional webpage navigation,
 * because (by design) it appears identical to the user. Accounting for the History
 * API is important, because it is used on some exceptionally popular websites (e.g.,
 * YouTube).
 *
 * # Page IDs
 * Each page ID is 128-bit value, randomly generated with the Web Crypto API and
 * stored as a hexadecimal `String`. While this representation is less efficient than
 * a `Uint8Array` or similar, it is more convenient for development and debugging. The
 * page ID is available in the content script environment.
 *
 * # Page Lifecycle
 * Each webpage has the following lifecycle events, which fire in both the background
 * page and content script environments.
 *   * Page Visit Start - The browser has started to load a webpage in a tab. This
 *     event is fired early in context script execution (i.e., soon after
 *     `document_start`). For a webpage with a new Document, the event is
 *     timestamped with the time the `window` object was created (the time origin
 *     from the High Resolution Time Level 2 API, in ms). For a webpage that does not
 *     have a new Document (i.e., resulting from the History API), the event is
 *     timestamped with the URL change in the WebNavigation API.
 *   * Page Visit Stop - The browser is unloading the webpage. Ordinarily this
 *     event fires and is timestamped with the `window` unload event. When the page
 *     changes via the History API, this event fires and is timestamped with the URL
 *     change in the WebNavigation API.
 *
 * # Attention Tracking
 * Attention to a page is defined as satisfying all of the following conditions.
 *   * The tab is the active tab in its browser window.
 *   * The window containing the tab is the current browser window.
 *   * The current browser window has focus in the operating system.
 *   * The operating system is not displaying a lock screen or screen saver.
 *   * Optional: The user has provided mouse or keyboard input within a specified time
 *     interval.
 *
 * In the content script environment, each page has an attention status, and an event
 * fires when that status changes. Attention update events are timestamped with events
 * from the WebExtensions `tabs`, `windows`, and `idle` APIs.
 *
 * # Audio Events
 * In the content script environment, each page has an audio status, and an event fires
 * when that status changes. Audio update events fire and are timestamped with events
 * from the WebExtensions `tabs` API.
 *
 * # Event Ordering
 * This module guarantees the ordering of page lifecycle, attention, and audio events.
 *   * Page visit start and page visit stop only fire once for each page, in that order.
 *   * Page attention and audio update events will only occur between page visit start
 *     and stop events.
 *
 * # Additional Implementation Notes
 * This module depends on the `idle` API, which has a couple quirks in Firefox:
 *   * There is a five-second interval when polling idle status from the operating
 *     system.
 *   * Depending on the platform, the idle API reports either time since user input to
 *     the browser or time since user input to the operating system.
 *
 * The polling interval coarsens the timing of page attention events related to idle state.
 * As long as the polling interval is relatively short in comparison to the idle threshold,
 * that should not be an issue.
 *
 * The platform-specific meaning of idle state should also not be an issue. There is only a
 * difference between the two meanings of idle state when the user is providing input to
 * another application; if the user is providing input to the browser, or is not providing
 * input at all, the two meanings are identical. In the scenario where the user is providing
 * input to another application, the browser will lose focus in the operating system; this
 * module will detect that with the windows API and fire a page attention event (if needed).
 *
 * Some implementation quirks to be aware of for future development on this module:
 *   * Non-browser windows do not appear in the results of `windows.getAll()`, and calling
 *     `windows.get()` on a non-browser window throws an error. Switching focus to a non-
 *     browser window will, however, fire the `windows.onFocusChanged` event. The module
 *     assumes that if `windows.onFocusChanged` fires with an unknown window, that window
 *     is a non-browser window.
 *   * The module assumes that valid tab IDs and window IDs are always >= 0.
 *
 * # Known Issues
 *   * The background script sends update messages to tabs regardless of whether they
 *     are ordinary tabs or have the pageManager content script running, because the
 *     background script does not track window types or tab content. The errors
 *     generated by this issue are caught in `messaging.sendMessageToTab`, and the
 *     issue should not cause any problems for studies.
 *
 * # Possible Improvements
 *   * Rebuild a page attention update event in the background page environment.
 *   * Rebuild the capability to fire events for pages that are already open when the module
 *     loads.
 *   * Add logic to handle the situation where the content script execution environment crashes,
 *     so the page visit stop message doesn't fire from the associated content script.
 *   * Add an event in the content script for detecting when content has lazily loaded into the
 *     DOM after the various DOM loading events (e.g., on Twitter).
