# WebScience
WebScience is an open-source library for building browser-based research studies, including on [Rally](https://rally.mozilla.org/).

## Design Goals
* Reduce the barriers to implementing browser-based research studies, by providing production-quality functionality that is commonly required, difficult to implement correctly, and difficult to maintain.
* Standardize measurement methods across browser-based research studies.
* Advance the state of the art in browser-based research methods, such as by providing a sophisticated model for user attention to web content.
* Encourage researchers to practice data minimization when implementing studies.
* Provide an API that is built on and consistent with [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions), and that is compatible with all major web browsers.

## Contributors
The primary contributors to WebScience are researchers at the [Princeton University Center for Information Technology Policy](https://citp.princeton.edu/) and the [Mozilla Rally](https://rally.mozilla.org/) team.

## Getting Started with WebScience
The easiest way to get started is with the Rally [study template](https://github.com/mozilla-rally/study-template), which has already been configured to integrate the WebScience library.

If you would prefer to build a browser extension with WebScience from scratch, we recommend the following steps:
* Use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for managing the extension's dependencies with a [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json) file and [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install). WebScience is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package [`@mozilla/web-science`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mozilla/web-science).
* Use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) with the [`node-resolve`](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/node-resolve) plugin to integrate WebScience into your bundled extension.

## Using WebScience in a Study Extension
Using WebScience in your study extension is easy. At the start of the background script where you want to use WebScience, just add:
```js
import * as webScience from "@mozilla/web-science";
```
You will then be able to use the WebScience API within the background script (e.g., `webScience.pageNavigation...`).

You can also selectively import components of the WebScience API, if you prefer. Just add, for example:
```js
import { pageNavigation, socialMediaLinkSharing } from "@mozilla/web-science";
```
You will then be able to use those components of the API (e.g., `pageNavigation...`).

## Exploring the WebScience API
We will have documentation for the WebScience API online shortly. In the interim, the WebScience source includes voluminous JSDoc annotations.
